            <p>A pomodoro clock is a time management tool that breaks work into intervals, usually 25 minutes long, separated by breaks. During the 25 minutes you are supposed to concentrate solely on your work. This tool is designed to aid users in combatting multi-tasking and improve concentration.</p>
            <p>This website contains a modified pomodoro clock. The work and break times are preset and there is no extended break time. You can complete as many pomodoros (focus sessions) as you would like. These are the general steps for using the pomodoro clock: </p>
            <p class="steps">1. Choose a specific task</p>
            <p class="steps">2. Start the clock.</p>
            <p class="steps">3. Work on the chosen task.</p>
            <p class="steps">4. Stop working when the focus time is over and take a brief break.</p>
            <p class="steps">5. Repeat these steps until you decide you would like to stop working or you have completed your chosen task.</p>
